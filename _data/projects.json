			bspline can be used to evaluate B-splines of varying orders on any type that can be linearly
			interpolated, ranging from floats, positions, RGB colors to transformation matrices and so on.

			The bspline logo (above) was generated using this library with a cubic B-spline in 2D for the
			positioning of the curve and a quadratic B-spline in RGB space to color it."
