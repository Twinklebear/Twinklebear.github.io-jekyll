		"description": "tray_rust is a toy physically based ray tracer built off of the techniques
			discussed in [Physically Based Rendering](http://pbrt.org/). It began life as a port of
			[tray](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray) to [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org)
			to check out the language.
			The renderer is currently capable of path tracing, supports triangle meshes (MTL support coming soon),
			and various physically based material models (including measured data from the
			[MERL BRDF Database](http://www.merl.com/brdf/)) along with rigid body animation
			and image-parallel distributed rendering. More
			details on rendering performance and other features can be found in the readme
			[README](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust/blob/master/README.md).\n\n

			tray_rust can also render animations, and is the renderer I've used for the University of Utah's
			[teapot rendering competition](http://graphics.cs.utah.edu/trc/) after the first year.
			The video is my submission from 2016. To simplify making scenes
			for tray_rust I also wrote a [Blender plugin](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust_blender)
			which I used to make the animation
			shown, and is the easiest way to create scenes for the renderer though some features
			are still needed."

			the CPU's vector units without needing hand-written intrinsics. Through this library it's easy
			to write very fast vector code in ISPC and link it with (still quick!) higher-level code
			in Rust to get a good balance of high performance and ease of use.\n\n
			The images shown above are from the
			[rt example](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ispc-rs/tree/master/examples/rt) (top row)

			and the [ddvol example](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ispc-rs/tree/master/examples/ddvol)

			renderer. Both use higher level Rust code to read in a scene file and setup
			the objects in the scene and then call into ISPC to render in parallel, making

			Ray packets were first introduced by [Wald et al., 2001](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~wald/Publications/2001/CRT/CRT.pdf)

        The isosurface extraction code
        is implemented in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly to accelerate extraction of the surface. Compared to
