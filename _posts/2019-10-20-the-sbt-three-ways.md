DirectX Ray Tracing, Vulkan's NV Ray Tracing extension, and OptiX (or collectively, the RTX APIs)
build on the same execution model for running user code to trace
and process rays. The user creates a *Shader Binding Table* (SBT), which consists of a set
of shader function handles and embedded parameters for these functions. The shaders in the table
are executed depending on whether or not a geometry was hit by a ray, and which geometry was hit.
When a geometry is hit a set of parameters specified on both the host and
device side of the application combine to determine which shader is executed.
The RTX APIs provide a great deal of flexibility in how the SBT can be set up and
indexed into during rendering, leaving a number of options open to applications.
However, with incorrect SBT access leading
to crashes and difficult bugs, sparse examples or documentation, and
subtle differences in naming and SBT setup between the APIs, properly setting up
and accessing the SBT is an especially thorny part of the RTX APIs for new users.

In this post we'll look at the similarities and differences of each ray tracing API's shader
binding table to gain a fundamental understanding of the execution model. I'll then
present an interactive tool for constructing the SBT, building a scene which uses it,
and executing trace calls on the scene to see which hit groups and miss shaders are called.
Finally, we'll look at how this model can be brought back to the CPU using Embree,
to potentially build a unified low-level API for ray tracing.

*Lead-in: some stuff like the SBT setup and how the different options for
tweaking how it's indexed can be confusing to work out. The information around
is a bit partial and most people are left to kind of work out the math or some
guess work to see what's going on. Here I'll explain each and provide an interactive
tool for playing with how the SBT is setup and indexed in the shader.
Also explain difference of a shader vs. the shader record, which is more like
a closure in that you need a SR for each unique combination of function and SBT parameters.*

# The RTX Execution Model

To motivate why the RTX APIs need a shader binding table, we can look at how 
ray tracing differs from rasterization.
In a rasterizer we can batch objects by the shader they use and thus
always know the set of shaders which must be called to render a set of objects.
However, in a ray tracer we don't know
which object a ray will hit when we trace it, and thus need the entire scene available
in memory (or some proxy of it) to process the ray. Our ray tracer needs both the data for
each object and a function to call for that object which can process intersections.
To render the scene we need access to all of the shaders which might be called, and a way
to associate them with the objects in the scene. Each of the RTX APIs does this through
the *Shader Binding Table*. An analogy in the rasterization pipeline is bindless rendering, where
the required data (textures, buffers) is uploaded to the GPU and accessed as needed by ID
at runtime in the shader. Our shader dispatch is now "bindless" in some sense.

</figure>

The different shaders used in the ray tracing pipeline are:

- Ray Generation: Called as the entry point to the ray tracer to generate the rays
    to be processed.
- Intersection: When using non-triangle geometry an intersection shader is required
    to compute ray intersections with the custom primitives. This isn't necessary
    for triangle meshes, as the ray-triangle intersection test is done in hardware.
- Any Hit: Is called for each potential intersection found along the ray,
    and can be used to filter potential intersections. For example, when using alpha
    cutout textures, the Any Hit shader is used to discard hits against the cutout regions
    of the geometry.
- Closest Hit: Is called for the closest hit found along the ray, and can compute and
    return intersection information through the ray payload or trace rays if performing
    shading in the Closest Hit shader is desired.
- Miss: When no hit is found for a ray, the miss shader is called. The Miss shader
    can be used to return a background color for primary rays, or mark occlusion rays
    as unoccluded.

[Ray Tracing Gems Book](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracinggems/),

given at SIGGRAPH 2019.

# The Shader Binding Table

*consists of a set of shader records, where each is a function (or functions for hit group)
and parameters for those functions*

The Shader Binding Table contains the entire set of shaders which may be called when ray tracing
the scene, along with embedded parameters to be passed to these shaders. Each pair
of shader functions and embedded parameters is referred to as a *Shader Record*.
Since it's common for objects to share the same shader code but access different
data, the embedded parameters in the record can be used to pass such data to
the shaders. Thus, there should be at least one Shader Record in the table for
each unique combination of shader functions and embedded parameters. It is possible
to write the same shader record multiple times in the table, and this may be
necessary depending on how the instances and geometries in the scene are specified.
Finally, it is also possible to simply use the instance and geometry IDs available
in the shaders to perform indirect access into other tables containing the scene data.

## Shader Record

*Think of a shader record like a closure, it combines a set of parameters + a function
to be called for some object or ray*

A Shader Record combines one or more shader functions with a set of parameters to
be passed to these functions when they're called by the runtime.
Each shader record is written into the SBT as a set of function handles followed by the
embedded parameters. While the size of the handles, alignment requirements for
the records and parameters which can be embedded in the table differ across
the RTX APIs, the functionality of the shader record is the same. 

#### Ray Generation

The Ray Generation shader record consists of a single function referring to the
ray generation shader to be used, along with any desired embedded parameters
for the function. While some parameters can be passed in the shader record, for things
which update each frame it can be easier to pass them separately through a
different globally accessible buffer.
While multiple ray generation shaders can be written into the table,
only one can be called for a specific launch.

#### Hit Group

Each Hit Group shader record consists of a Closest Hit shader,
Any Hit shader (optional) and Intersection shader (optional), followed by
the set of embedded parameters to be made available to the three shaders.
As the hit group which should be called is dependent on the instance
and geometry which were hit and the ray type, the indexing rules for hit groups are
the most complicated. The rules for hit group indexing are discussed in detail
below.

#### Miss

The Miss shader record consists of a single function referring to the miss shader
to be used, along with any desired embedded parameters for the function,
similar to the ray generation record. The miss shader which is called is selected
by the ray type, though is specified separately from the hit group ray type to
allow greater flexibility. This flexibility can be used for optimizations to
[occlusion rays, for example](/graphics/2019/09/06/faster-shadow-rays-on-rtx).

## Hit Group Shader Record Index Calculation

The main point of difficulty in setting up the SBT and scene geometry is understanding
how the two are coupled together, i.e., if a geometry is hit by a ray,
which shader record is called? The shader record to call is determined by parameters set on the
instance, trace ray call and the order of geometries in the bottom-level acceleration structure.
These parameters are set on both the host and device during different parts of the scene
and pipeline setup and execution, making it difficult to see how they fit together.

The equation used to determine which hit group record is called when a ray with SBT
offset $$R_\text{offset}$$ and stride $$ R_\text{stride} $$ hits a geometry is:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{HG} = \&\text{HG}[0] + \left( \text{HG}_\text{stride} \times
    \left( R_\text{offset} + R_\text{stride} \times \mathbb{G}_\text{ID} + \mathbb{I}_\text{offset} \right)\right)
\end{align}
$$

Where $$\mathbb{I}_\text{offset}$$ is the SBT offset of the instance containing the geometry,
and $$\mathbb{G}_\text{ID}$$ is the index of the hit geometry in the list of geometries in the instance.
$$\&\text{HG}[0]$$ is the starting address of the table containing the hit group records, and $$\text{HG}_\text{stride}$$
is the stride between hit group records (in bytes) in the SBT.

> Note: If you're coming from Ray Tracing Gems, in 3.10 the parameter $$R_\text{offset}$$ is referred
> to as $$I_\text{ray}$$, and $$R_\text{stride}$$ is referred to as $$\mathbb{G}_\text{mult}$$.
> While the equations are the same, I think the distinction of which parameters come from the ray,
> geometry and instance are clearer when written as above.

The ray offset ($$R_\text{offset}$$) and stride ($$R_\text{stride}$$) parameters are set per-ray
when you call trace ray on the device. In a typical ray tracer, $$R_\text{offset}$$ is the ray type,
e.g., primary (0) or occlusion (1), and $$R_\text{stride}$$ is the total number of ray types, in this example, 2.
These parameters allow us to change which hit group is called based on
the desired ray query. For example, we can often perform a cheaper intersection test for occlusion
rays since we only care if the object was hit, but don't need the exact hit point.
The ray stride lets us
stride over the hit groups by the number of different ray queries we want to perform, similar to a 2D array
of elements. In a typical ray tracer where we would have a separate primary and occlusion hit group
record per-geometry, this stride would be 2.

The instance offset ($$\mathbb{I}_\text{offset}$$) and geometry id ($$\mathbb{G}_\text{ID}$$)
come from how each instance is configured when setting up the scene on the host. Each instance takes
a base offset into the SBT, which defines where its sub-table of hit group
records begins. Note that this is not multiplied by $$R_\text{stride}$$ in Equation 1.
The geometry id, $$\mathbb{G}_\text{ID}$$, is set implicitly as the index of the geometry
in the bottom-level acceleration structure being instanced, and is multiplied by the ray stride.
In a typical ray tracer with two ray types (primary and occlusion), a hit group record for each ray type
per-geometry and instances do not share hit group records, the offset
$$\mathbb{I}_\text{offset}^i$$ for instance $$i$$ can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{I}_\text{offset}^i &= \mathbb{I}_\text{offset}^{i - 1} + \mathbb{I}_\text{geom}^{i - 1} \times 2 \\
\text{where} \;\; \mathbb{I}_\text{offset}^0 &= 0 \\
\end{align}
$$

Where $$\mathbb{I}_\text{geom}^i$$ are the number of geometries in instance $$i$$.

The hit group records in the SBT would then be written in order by instance and the geometry order within
the instance, with separate primary and occlusion hit groups. A scene with two instances, the first
with one geometry and the second with two, would have its hit group records laid out as shown below.

    <i>SBT Hit Group record layout for a typical ray tracer with two ray types

    is 32 bytes, with a stride of 64 bytes. When tracing a ray, \( R_\text{stride} = 2 \),
    and \( R_\text{offset} \)will be 0 for primary rays and 1 for occlusion rays.
	</i></figcaption>
</figure>

*Depends on:*

- *instance's sbt offset*
- *order of geometry in the instance*
- *ray sbt offset*
- *ray sbt stride*

## Miss Shader Record Index Calculation

The indexing rules for miss shader records are far simpler than for hit groups. When
tracing a ray we pass an additional miss shader offset, $$R_\text{miss}$$ which is just
the index of the miss shader to call if the ray does not hit an object.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{M} = \&\text{M}[0] + \text{M}_\text{stride} \times  R_\text{miss}
\end{align}
$$

As with the hit group records, $$ \&\text{M}[0] $$ is the starting address of the table containing
the miss records and $$\text{M}_\text{stride}$$ is the stride between miss records
in bytes.

# API Specific Details

Now that we have a unified terminology to work with across the RTX APIs, and took a brief
look at how the Shader Binding Table works, we'll dive into the API-specific details of the SBT
for each API before getting to the interactive SBT builder widget. 
The most important difference is in how the embedded parameters for a shader record
are specified, and the typos of parameters which can be embedded.
The shader record handles and the alignment requirements for them in the SBT can
also differ between the different APIs.

## DirectX Ray Tracing

For more documentation about the DXR API, also see the
[MSDN DXR Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/direct3d-12-raytracing),
the [DXR HLSL Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/direct3d-12-raytracing-hlsl-shaders)
and the [DXR Specification](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/Raytracing.html).
Here we'll just focus on the parts specific to the Shader Binding Table indexing.

### Shader Records and Parameters

In DXR, the parameters embedded in the shader record can be 8-byte handles
(e.g., to buffers, textures, etc.) or pairs of 4-byte constants (any single 4-byte constant
must be padded to 8-bytes). The mapping of these input parameters from the shader record
to the shader "registers" is specified using a
[Local Root Signature](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/Raytracing.html#resource-binding).
The registers used for the local root signature parameters should not overlap with
any coming from the global root signature, which is shared by all shaders. 
One way to avoid conflicts is to use separate register spaces for the global and
local root signature parameter registers. 

The shader handle size is defined by `D3D12_SHADER_IDENTIFIER_SIZE_IN_BYTES` (32 bytes),
the shader record alignment requirement is `D3D12_RAYTRACING_SHADER_TABLE_BYTE_ALIGNMENT` (64 bytes).
The maximum size allowed for the stride is 4096 bytes, placing an upper bound on the number of
parameters which can be embedded for a shader.

### Instance Parameters

Instances in DXR are specified through the [`D3D12_RAYTRACING_INSTANCE_DESC`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_raytracing_instance_desc)
structure:

{% highlight c++ %}
typedef struct D3D12_RAYTRACING_INSTANCE_DESC {
  FLOAT Transform[3];
  UINT InstanceID : 24;
  UINT InstanceMask : 8;
  UINT InstanceContributionToHitGroupIndex : 24;
  UINT Flags : 8;
  D3D12_GPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS AccelerationStructure;
} D3D12_RAYTRACING_INSTANCE_DESC;
{% endhighlight %}

The parameters which effect the SBT indexing are:

- `InstanceContributionToHitGroupIndex`: This sets the instance's SBT offset, $$\mathbb{I}_\text{offset}$$
- `InstanceMask`: While the mask does not effect which hit group is called, it can
    be used to skip traversal of instances entirely, by masking them out of the traversal

### Trace Ray Parameters

In the ray generation, closest hit and miss shaders the HLSL 
[TraceRay](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/traceray-function) function
can be called to trace rays through the scene.

{% highlight glsl %}
Template<payload_t>
void TraceRay(RaytracingAccelerationStructure AccelerationStructure,
              uint RayFlags,
              uint InstanceInclusionMask,
              uint RayContributionToHitGroupIndex,
              uint MultiplierForGeometryContributionToHitGroupIndex,
              uint MissShaderIndex,
              RayDesc Ray,
              inout payload_t Payload);
{% endhighlight %}

TraceRay takes the acceleration structure to trace against, a set of ray flags to adjust the traversal being
performed, the mask and SBT indexing parameters, the ray and the payload to be updated by the
closest hit or miss shaders.

- `InstanceInclusionMask`: This mask effects which instances are masked out by and'ing it
    with each instance's `InstanceMask`.
- `RayContributionToHitGroupIndex`: This is the ray's SBT offset, $$R_\text{offset}$$.
- `MultiplierForGeometryContributionToHitGroupIndex`: This is the ray's SBT stride $$R_\text{stride}$$.
- `MissShaderIndex`: This is the miss shader index to call, $$R_\text{miss}$$.

## Vulkan Ray Tracing

For more documentation about the Vulkan NV Ray Tracing extension, also
[extension specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_NV_ray_tracing),
[manual page](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_ray_tracing.html)
and the [GLSL NV Ray Tracing extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL/blob/master/extensions/nv/GLSL_NV_ray_tracing.txt).

### Shader Records and Parameters

In Vulkan, the parameters embedded in the shader record can only be 4-byte constants,
but do not require extra padding to 8-bytes as in DXR. The embedded parameters are
passed to the appear as a special buffer type declared with the `shaderRecordNV` layout.
For example, if we wanted to pass a material ID for the geometry in the shader record
we could declare the buffer as follows:

{% highlight glsl %}
layout(shaderRecordNV) buffer SBTData {
    uint32_t material_id;
};
{% endhighlight %}

The size of the shader handles and alignment requirements for the shader records
are queried at runtime by querying the
[`VkPhysicalDeviceRayTracingPropertiesNV`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceRayTracingPropertiesNV.html).
On my desktop with an RTX 2070 and Nvidia driver XXX the shader handle size
is 16 bytes, and the shader record alignment requirement is 64 bytes.
The maximum allowed size for the shader record stride is XXX bytes.

### Instance Parameters

Instances in Vulkan are specified through the same structure layout as in DXR
(see [Vulkan Spec on Acceleration Structures](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#acceleration-structure)).
However, a definition is not provided in the headers and we must declare
our own struct which matches the specified layout:

{% highlight c++ %}
struct GeometryInstance {
    float transform[12];
    uint32_t instance_custom_index : 24;
    uint32_t mask : 8;
    uint32_t instance_offset : 24;
    uint32_t flags : 8;
    uint64_t acceleration_structure_handle;
};
{% endhighlight %}

The parameters which effect the SBT indexing are:

- `instance_offset`: This sets the instance's SBT offset, $$\mathbb{I}_\text{offset}$$
- `mask`: While the mask does not effect which hit group is called, it can
    be used to skip traversal of instances entirely, by masking them out of the traversal

### Trace Ray Parameters

In the ray generation, closest hit and miss shaders the function [traceNV](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL/blob/master/extensions/nv/GLSL_NV_ray_tracing.txt#L687-L697) from
the GLSL NV Ray Tracing extension can be called to trace rays.

{% highlight glsl %}
 void traceNV(accelerationStructureNV topLevel,
              uint rayFlags,
              uint cullMask,
              uint sbtRecordOffset,
              uint sbtRecordStride,
              uint missIndex,
              vec3 origin,
              float Tmin,
              vec3 direction,
              float Tmax,
              int payload);
{% endhighlight %}

traceNV takes the acceleration structure to trace against,
a set of ray flags to adjust the traversal being
performed, the mask and SBT indexing parameters, the ray parameters
and the index of the ray payload to be updated by the closest hit or miss shaders.

- `cullMask`: This mask effects which instances are masked out by and'ing it
    with each instance's `mask`.
- `sbtRecordOffset`: This is the ray's SBT offset, $$R_\text{offset}$$.
- `sbtRecordStride`: This is the ray's SBT stride $$R_\text{stride}$$.
- `missIndex`: This is the miss shader index to call, $$R_\text{miss}$$.

In contrast to HLSL, the ray payloads are specified as special shader input/output
variable, where the value of `payload` passed to traceNV selects which
one will be used. For example:

{% highlight glsl %}
struct RayPayload {
    vec3 hit_pos;
    vec3 normal;
};
layout(location = 0) rayPayloadNV RayPayload payload;
{% endhighlight %}

## OptiX

For more documentation about OptiX see the
[OptiX 7 Programming Guide](https://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/optix7/guide/index.html#introduction#)
and the [OptiX 7 Course](https://gitlab.com/ingowald/optix7course) from SIGGRAPH 2019.

### Shader Records and Parameters

In OptiX, the parameters embedded in the shader record can be arbitrary structs,
potentially containing CUDA device pointers or texture handles.
A pointer to the embedded parameters for the shader can be retrieved with the
`optixGetSbtDataPointer()` function, which returns a `void*` to the data
after the shader handle.

The size of the shader handle is defined by `OPTIX_SBT_RECORD_HEADER_SIZE` (32 bytes),
the shader record alignment requirement is `OPTIX_SBT_RECORD_ALIGNMENT` (16 bytes).

### Instance Parameters

Instances in OptiX are specified through the [`OptixInstance`](https://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/optix7/api/html/struct_optix_instance.html)
structure:

{% highlight c++ %}
struct OptixInstance {
    float transform[12];
    unsigned int instanceId;
    unsigned int sbtOffset;
    unsigned int visibilityMask;
    unsigned int flags;
    OptixTraversableHandle traversableHandle;
    unsigned int pad[2];
};
{% endhighlight %}

The parameters which effect the SBT indexing are:

- `sbtOffset`: This sets the instance's SBT offset, $$\mathbb{I}_\text{offset}$$
- `visibilityMask`: While the mask does not effect which hit group is called, it can
    be used to skip traversal of instances entirely, by masking them out of the traversal

### Trace Ray Parameters

In the ray generation, closest hit and miss shaders the
[optixTrace](https://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/optix7/api/html/group__optix__device__api.html)
function can be called to trace rays through the scene.

{% highlight c %}
void optixTrace(OptixTraversableHandle handle,
                float3 rayOrigin,
                float3 rayDirection,
                float tmin,
                float tmax,
                float rayTime,
                OptixVisibilityMask visibilityMask,
                unsigned int rayFlags,
                unsigned int SBToffset,
                unsigned int SBTstride,
                unsigned int missSBTIndex,
                // up to 8 32-bit values to be passed through registers
                // unsigned int &p0-p7
)
{% endhighlight %}

optixTrace takes the acceleration structure to trace against, a set of ray flags to adjust the traversal being
performed, the mask and SBT indexing parameters, the ray parameters and up to 8 unsigned 32-bit values
which are passed through registers to the closest hit and miss shaders. To pass a struct larger
than 32 bytes it's possible to pass a pointer to a stack variable in the calling shader
through 2 32-bit ints, and pack the pointer together in the closest hit or miss shader.

- `visibilityMask`: This mask effects which instances are masked out by and'ing it
    with each instance's `visibilityMask`.
- `SBToffset`: This is the ray's SBT offset, $$R_\text{offset}$$.
- `SBTstride`: This is the ray's SBT stride $$R_\text{stride}$$.
- `missSBTIndex`: This is the miss shader index to call, $$R_\text{miss}$$.

# Interactive SBT Builder

Now that we've discussed the how the SBT works and what parts of the SBT,
instance and trace ray setup are similar or different between the RTX APIs,
lets do some hands on activities! Using the interactive tool below
you can build a shader binding table, setup a scene,
set the trace ray parameters and visualize which hit groups are called for
the different geometries. Use this tool to explore different possible configurations
for the SBT to get a better understanding of how the different parameters
can be combined for different renderer and scene configurations.

*Configurations to try:*

- "standard ray tracer" with a two ray types (primary/occlusion) and a hit group record
    and miss record for each type
- RFO style, only primary hit groups but miss record for primary and occlusion
- Single hit group shared by all. I think this is do-able if you always use instance ID and
    (i think geom index is now available too?) to pick your params from separate global buffers.

<!--
Here I'm thinking to put some D3 interactive example where you can build your
own SBT and see how the different instance, geometry and trace ray parameters
effect what entries in the SBT are accessed.

Things this should support:

- <s>need to account for the single stride param for each SBT group, right now
      it only does the alignment part.</s>
- <s>adding/removing miss groups</s>
- <s>adding/removing hit groups</s>
- <s>changing the parameters for the different shader records (add/remove)</s>
- <s>changing the API backend</s>
- <s>view the dispatch rays desc with the stride/offset/etc. values</s>
- <s>multiple geom per-instance, see what the instance contribution should be for different
    ray types in the scene</s>
- <s>changing the trace ray parameters to see which hit groups are accessed for specific
    instances and geometries</s>
- <s>see which hit group is called for a specific geometry given the current indexing params</s>
- <s>see which miss group is called for a specific trace call</s>
- <s>also show and talk about the instance mask and how this can be used</s>
- also make clear that the different shader records can be stored in different buffers

The interactive graphic style I'd like to be similar to that used in RT Gems, but with
the ability to switch API. Note that switching the API will potentially lead to making
invalid SBT entries because the data that can be set differs and how they should be
aligned. Maybe it would be better to be able to view all 3 at once, or just reset the
data when the API is switched.
-->

## Shader Binding Table

You can add new hit and miss records with the buttons below, or remove them by double-clicking
the record. Click a shader record to select it and add or remove parameters,
add parameters using the buttons below or double click the parameter to remove them.
When you select a hit group the instance containing the geometry which would call the hit group
when hit by a ray for the current scene and trace ray setup is selected. If more than
one geometry share the same hit group, the first one will be highlighted.

You can also change the ray tracing API to see how the different handle sizes
and alignment requirements effect the SBT layout in memory. While it is also possible
to use separate buffers for the ray generation, hit group and miss records I've kept
them all in one buffer here to simplify the visualization.

## Scene Setup

Here you can setup the scene you want to trace rays against by adding or removing instances
and geometries within instances or change each instance's mask.
To add an instance use the button below, to remove one double click on its BVH icon
or geometries. Select an instance by clicking on it to modify its SBT offset, number of geometries and
visibility mask with the inputs below. Setting to the recommended offset
will set a configuration similar to that shown in Figure 2, using Equations 2 and 3.
The geometry ID (\(\mathbb{G}_\text{ID}\)) within the instance is displayed next to each geometry in the widget.

The hit groups accessed by the selected instance will also be highlighted in light blue
in the shader binding table. Click a specific geometry in the scene to see the corresponding hit
group which will be called when intersected by the ray traced in the current trace ray call.
If a geometry would access an out of bounds for the current trace call, it will be highlighted in red.
If the instance potentially accesses out of bounds hit groups (i.e., across the ray stride)
a warning will be displayed when it is selected.
Instances which are masked out of the current ray traversal will be grayed out.

## Trace Ray

Here you can setup your trace ray call to set the ray SBT offset, stride and miss index.
After setting up the trace call click on geometries in the scene to see which hit group
will be called!

# Extra: An SBT for Embree

Now that we've seen the similarities between the RTX API's shader binding table setup,
this leads us to an interesting question: If we wanted to write a unified model
for programming the GPU APIs, we'd implement a way to wrap over the RTX
execution model and shader table, but what about the CPU? On the CPU we can use [Embree](https://www.embree.org/)
to accelerate ray traversal to act as our "hardware-accelerated" API,
[ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/) as our SPMD programming language for vectorization
and [TBB](https://github.com/intel/tbb) for multi-threading; however, the natural
way to write our CPU ray tracer would differ significantly from an RTX one, since we don't
have the rest of the RTX execution model, shader table and so on. But since we're on
the CPU we have pretty much full control over how the code is setup and run,
so what if we just implemented the same execution model on top of Embree, ISPC and TBB?

I've begun exploring exactly this idea in the [embree-sbt branch of ChameleonRT](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/embree-sbt/embree),
and now support enough features to re-implement my original embree path tracer backend in this
Embree-SBT model (two ray types, shader record parameters, opaque geometry).
Since ISPC is somewhat similar to CUDA, I've followed
the OptiX style of SBT in my implementation. The shader handles are just
ISPC function pointers which then are passed a `void*` to the region
following the handle containing any user-provided struct of embedded parameters.
On the ISPC side I provide a
[trace ray wrapper function](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/embree-sbt/embree/render_embree.ispc#L110-L146)
which calls `rtcIntersect` or `rtcOccluded` as appropriate and computes Equations 1 or 4
to determine which hit group or miss shader to call from the shader table.
What's most interesting to note here is that not only does this work,
but in my limited testing it actually seems to perform slightly better than my original implementation!

# Final Thoughts

Now that we've gotten an understanding of the RTX and SBT execution model and
even seen how this model can be brought back to the CPU, we might find ourselves
pointed in a pretty exciting direction. Although not discussed in this post,
the rest of the host-side RTX APIs (e.g., setting up geometries) are also quite similar,
and we can implement anything we want on top of Embree to make it fit in.
The most challenging difference between the APIs to hide are the different
languages used to write the shaders (HLSL, GLSL, CUDA, ISPC),
the different ways the shader modules are setup, and how they receive parameters
embedded in the shader record and from global state. If we squint a little
bit the four languages are actually [very similar](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/hyperrender),
but we're still left with difficult differences to hide in how the host sets up
the shader models and parameters, and how those parameters are received by the shaders.

To unify these final differences in shader setup and parameters, it seems like what we
really need is a programming language similar to HLSL, GLSL, ISPC and CUDA, but which
gives us enough information that we can hook up the shader record and global
parameters the user wants across all four APIs. Since the rest of the APIs are
so similar, I think this is not a big stretch to implement. My end goal
is to write a host and device side codepath for my path tracer in [ChameleonRT](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/)
which can then run on all three RTX APIs and Embree. I've got to learn
about compilers to do that, but watch this blog
or follow me on [Twitter]() for updates.
