The Apple M1 available in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13", and Mac Mini has
been the focus of a ton of benchmarking writeups and blog posts about
the new chip. The performance overall, and especially performance/watt,
that Apple has achieved with the chip is impressive.
As a ray tracing person, what caught my eye the most was the
performance AnandTech reported in their
[CineBench benchmarks](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2).
These scores were 1.6x-2x higher than I got on my old desktop and laptop!
I had also been interested in trying out the new
[ray tracing API for Metal](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/)
that was announced at WWDC this year,
which bears some resemblance to the DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX
GPU ray tracing APIs, and to Embree on CPUs.
So, I decided to pick up the Mac Mini to do some testing
on my own interactive ray tracing project,
[ChameleonRT](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT),
and to try getting it running on the new Metal ray tracing API.
In this post, we'll take a look at the new Metal ray tracing
API to see how it lines up with DXR, Vulkan, OptiX and Embree,
and make some fair (and some extremely unfair) ray tracing performance
comparisons against the M1.

In my free time I've been developing [ChameleonRT](https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT),
which is an interactive path tracer that runs on top of multiple
CPU or GPU ray tracing acceleration libraries (Embree, DirectX, Vulkan, OptiX).

CineBench is a CPU-based ray tracer, and uses [Embree](https://www.embree.org/)
internally for accelerating ray tracing on CPUs.
