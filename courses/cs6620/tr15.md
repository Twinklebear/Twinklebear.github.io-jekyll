The animation is 1920x1080 and was rendered at 2048 samples per pixel. To get 25 seconds of animation at 24 frames
per second we need to render 600 individual frames. Each frame is saved out as a separate png, to produce
the animation I used ffmpeg to stitch them together into a video.

The animation contains quite a few different models:

- The Stanford Bunny, Buddha, Dragon and Lucy are from the
[Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)
- The Utah Teapot (I used [Morgan McGuire's version](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml))
- Low-poly pine trees by [Kenney](http://kenney.nl/)
- The Ajax bust is from [jotero](http://forum.jotero.com/viewtopic.php?t=3)
- A Rust logo model by [Nylithius](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?362836-Rust-language-3D-logo)
- The Cow model is from Viewpoint Animation, I downloaded the model from the Suggestive Contours paper
[example page](http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/sugcon/models/).

I also make use of a mix of analytic and measured material models, the measured materials come
from the [MERL BRDF Database](http://www.merl.com/brdf/).

## Stills

If you'd prefer to just see some stills from the animation I've put a few frames here that show off different
parts of the animation. I really recommend watching the full video though, it's very cool.

# Compute Time

When I rendered this animation tray\_rust didn't support true distributed rendering (multiple machines
cooperating on a single frame), however a simple and effective
approach is to assign a subset of the frames to different machines so they split the work.
Since each frame is saved out as a png each node's job is completely independent of the others so we can
just launch the renderer on a bunch of machines and not worry much about fault handling or
communication overhead (since there's none). This actually achieves pretty effective use of a cluster,
as long as you have more frames than nodes.

To render the scene I used two clusters at my lab which don't get much use over the weekend. I used 40 nodes
with two Xeon X5550's per node on one cluster and 20 nodes with two Xeon E5-2660's per node on the other,
for a total of 1280 logical cores (640 physical). I tried to balance the performance of the nodes when
assigning frames to aim for an even-ish work distribution. The scene took a wall time of about 53 hours to render
due to some of my jobs starting a bit later than other ones. The total wall time (sum of all nodes) is 2772 hours
(16.5 weeks!), on average rendering took about 46.2 hours per node (wall time). The total CPU time
(sum of all nodes) was 56853 hours (6.486 years!). Without using these clusters I don't think I would have
been able to render in such high quality, just due to how long it would have taken. I definitely need to
spend some more time improving the performance of tray\_rust.

# [Open Source!](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust)

This animation was rendered with my ray tracer tray\_rust, which is an open source path tracer
I've written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a new programming language from Mozilla. Check
out the source on [Github](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust)!
